Decision Points is the extraordinary account of Americas 43rd president. 
Shattering the conventions of political autobiography, George W. Bush offers a 
strikingly candid journey through the defining decisions of his life.
In gripping, neverbeforeheard detail, President Bush brings readers inside 
the Texas Governors Mansion on the night of the hotly contested 2000 election; 
aboard Air Force One on 9/11, in the hours after Americas most devastating 
attack since Pearl Harbor; at the head of the table in the Situation Room in 
the moments before launching the war in Iraq; and behind the Oval Office desk 
for his historic and controversial decisions on the financial crisis, Hurricane 
Katrina, Afghanistan, Iran, and other issues that have shaped the first decade 
of the twentyfirst century.
President Bush writes honestly and directly about his flaws and mistakes, as 
well as his accomplishments reforming education, treating HIV/AIDS in Africa, and 
safeguarding the country amid chilling warnings of additional terrorist attacks. 
He also offers intimate new details on his decision to quit drinking, discovery 
of faith, and relationship with his family.
Decision Points will captivate supporters, surprise critics, and change 
perspectives on one of the most consequential eras in American history and the 
man at the center of events.
